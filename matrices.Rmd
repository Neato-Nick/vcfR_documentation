title: "Extracting matrices from vcfR objects"
---


The data contained in VCF files presents a challenge to analysis in that the data are not strictly tabular and are large.
Because the data are not strictly tabular we need to find ways to coerce the data into tables or matrices.
Once the data is stored as a matrix it can be operated on by numerous R functions and packages.
Because the data are large, this process needs to happen in a computationally efficent manner.
Here we explore how vcfR facilitates these tasks.
