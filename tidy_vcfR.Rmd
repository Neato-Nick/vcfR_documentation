title: "tidy vcfR"
---


Much of the functionality of vcfR was built around R and it's base graphics system.
More recently, the concept of 'tidy data' has been described in the [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) article and implemented in the CRAN package [tidyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyr) (and an increasing number of packages).
In order to accomodate the audience that is interested in working with vcfR in a 'tidy' framework, several functions have been added. (Thank you Eric!)


```{r}
#vcfR2tidy()
#extract_info_tidy()
#extract_gt_tidy()
#vcf_field_names()
```
