title: "Export to *.vcf.gz"

## Data import

We will use the example dataset provided by vcfR.


```{r}
library(vcfR)
data(vcfR_example)
```


## Creating *.vcf.gz format files.


The function **write.vcf()** can be used to create *.vcf.gz files (gzipped VCF files) from objects of class vcfR or chromR.
These VCF files can be used for any downstream analysis which uses VCF files as input.


```{r write.vcf, eval=FALSE}
write.vcf(vcf, "test.vcf.gz")
```
