title: "vcfR objects"
---


The package vcfR uses two objects to contain data: vcfR and chromR.
The chromR object will be covered in a later section.
The vcfR object is intended to contain data read in from a variant call format (VCF) file.
Once stored in this object the data may be manipulated in a number of ways.
It may also be used as part of the more complicated chromR object.
Here we provide an overview of the vcfR object.
