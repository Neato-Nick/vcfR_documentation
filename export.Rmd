title: "Export of vcfR data"
---


Within vcfR we use a vcfR object to contain our data.
Once we have performed some manipulations we may want to convert the data to some other format for further analysis.
Within vcfR we have several options.

* Output to VCF (gzipped)
* Convert to genind and genclone objects
* Convert to genlight and snpclone objects
* Convert to DNAbin object
